<p>A timeline of my college application process, largely for my own reference, because I still mostly don't actually believe I'm attending college:
	<dl>
		<dt>Early June</dt>
			<dd>graduate from highschool! Stretched junior and senior year out over two years each so I originally was in class of 2016</dd>
		<dt>Late June</dt>
			<dd>learn that I do actually still qualify for SEED, but only if I start attending school this fall</dd>
		<dt>July 5</dt>
			<dd>contact admissions about the process for late admissions
		<dt>July 11</dt>
			<dd>am instructed to complete the common app</dt>
		<dt>July 15</dt>
			<dd>Start the common app</dd>
		<dt>July 26</dt>
			<dd>complete common app, discover the site has been taken offline (!) when you go to submit your personal essay</dd>
		<dt>Aug 1</dt>
			<dd>actually submit the common app</dd>
			<dd>email my contact in admissions, who never responds</dd>
		<dt>Aug 15</dt>
			<dd>Automated email saying my application is being processed</dd>
		<dt>Aug 16</dt>
			<dd>Go catsit for MER, who's house does not have reliable cell service</dd>
		<dt>Aug 26</dt>
			<dd>Finally track down a <em>different</em> person in admissions, who is actually in office and promises to handle my application personally, as classes are starting tomorrow</dd>
			<dd>Look at online course catalogue and make some educated guesses as to which classes I need to take</dd>
			<dd>Get home from catsitting approx 11:30PM</dd>
		<dt>Aug 27</dt>
			<dd>show up to classes despite not even being technically accepted yet</dd>
			<dd>FAFSA</dd>
		<dt>Aug 28</dt>
			<dd>recieve an official acceptance letter from admissions</dd>
			<dd>contact IT because the application landing page isn't letting me pay my deposit</dd>
			<dd>go to more classes I'm not registered for</dd>
			<dd>actually pay my deposit</dd>
		<dt>Aug 29</dt>
			<dd>meet my advisor & enroll</dd>
			<dd>contact IT because my school email has somehow already gotten messed up</dt>
			<dd>descover no school email = Central Authentication Service = no Canvas = no syllabi</dd>
			<dd>make egg pasta, because your great aunt is visiting</dd>
			<dd>start to write a journal entry about how you feel about being in college, because your english class lets you submit a journal for extra credit</dd>
			<dd>realize you have <em>no idea</em> how you feel because you mostly haven't processed the fact that you actually are, in fact, in college</dd>
	</dl>
